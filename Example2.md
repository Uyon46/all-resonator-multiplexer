## Example 2

![topo_example2](https://github.com/Uyon46/all-resonator-multiplexer/raw/master/example2.jpg)

Example 2 is a 10-resonator diplexer with asymmetric channel responses. The topology was introduced in [2]. The normalized specifications are

* _Channel 1_: Passband: (−1, −0.661); Return loss level: 20dB.
* _Channel 2_: Passband: (0.709, 1.0); Return loss level: 20dB. 
* Isolation levels within passbands are better than 80dB.

The branch coupled with P2 occupies the Channel 1 while the one coupled with P3 occupies the Channel 2. 
The external quality factors are qe1 = 3.0818, qe2 = 5.7326 and qe3 = 6.6648. 

Based on the normalized specification, the objective function is defined as
