Example 3 is a 9-resoantor diplexer with cross-couplings in two channels which make the optimization more difficult than the first two examples. This topology was proposed in [3]. The normalized specifications are 

* _Channel 1_: Passband: (−1, −0.203); Return loss level is better than 20dB;
* _Channel 2_: Passband: (−0.026, 1); Return loss level: 20dB;
* Isolation levels within passbands are better than 30dB.

The channel filter coupled with P2 occupies the Channel 1 while the other channel filter occupies the Channel 2. The external quality factors are qe1 = 1.0475, qe2 = 2.3395 and qe3 = 1.8969. Based on the normalized specifications, the objective function is defined as
