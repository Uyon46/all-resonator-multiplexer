## Example 4

Example 4 is a 12-order diplexer. Existing the shared resonator 4, the topology of example 4 contains 4 cross-couplings. and the specifications demand high isolations within the passband and narrow guard band. The main ideas of this topology were referred to [4].

The normalized specifications of example 4 are
